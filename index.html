    <p>This game will help you practice your understanding of the difference between a noun, an adjective, a verb and an adverb. 
    We'll start with a few questions before building sentences with the words you have looked at.</p>
    <p>Here is a reminder of the basics...</p>
    <span class="word-class">A noun </span>is a...</p>
    <span class="word-class"> An adjective </span>is a...</p>
    <span class="word-class">A verb </span>is a...</p>
    <span class="word-class">An adverb </span>is a...</p>
    <p>For example, can you see where the noun is, where the adjective is and where the verb is in the following sentence?</p>
    <h3>The black cat runs quickly.</h3>
    <p>(n) cat</p>
    <p>(a) black</p>
    <p>(v) runs</p>
    <p>(av) quickly</p>
