    <p>This game will help teach you the difference between a noun, an adjective and a verb. 
    We'll start with a few questions, and then we'll start building sentences.</p>
    <p>Here is a reminder of the basics...</p>
    <h2>A noun</h2><p>(n) is a...</p>
    <h2>An adjective</h2><p></p>(a) is a...</p>
    <h2>A verb</h2><p>(v) is a...</p>
    <p>For example, can you see where the noun is, where the adjective is and where the verb is in the following sentence?</p>
    <h3>The black cat runs up the street.</h3>
    <p>(n) cat</p>
    <p>(a) black</p>
    <p>(v) runs</p>
